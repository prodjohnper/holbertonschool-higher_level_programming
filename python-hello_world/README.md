## Description

This is my project sibmission for *Holberton Coding School's* module of *Python - Hello, World*. We learned how to use the Python interpreter, how to print text and variables using *print*, how to use strings, what are indexing and slicing and what is the official *Python coding style* and how to check your code with *[Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)*.
