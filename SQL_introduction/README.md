## Description

This is my submission to the _Holberton Coding School_ module of _SQL - Introduction_. In this module we worked and learned about what’s a `database`, what’s a `relational database`, what does `SQL` stand for, what’s `MySQL`, how to create a database in MySQL, what does `DDL` and `DML` stand for, how to `CREATE` or `ALTER` a table, how to `SELECT` data from a table, how to `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` data, what are `subqueries` and how to use `MySQL` functions
