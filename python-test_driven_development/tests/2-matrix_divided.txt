The "matrix_divided" doctest
========================

Tests the matrix_divided function from 2-matrix_divided
for any edge cases that may break the functionality
of the imported function.

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2 ,3], ["a", "b", "c"]], 3)
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2 ,3], [4, 5]], 3)
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "hello")
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 0)
... except ZeroDivisionError as e:
...     print(e)
