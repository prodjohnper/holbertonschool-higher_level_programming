## Description

This is my submission to the *Holberton Coding School* module of *Python Data Structures*. In this module we worked and learned about what are *lists* and how to use them, what are the *differences* and *similarities* between *strings* and *lists*, what are the *most common methods* of lists, how to use lists as *stacks* and *queues*, what are *list comprehensions*, what are *tuples*, when to use *tuples versus lists*, what is a *sequence*, what is *tuple packing*, what is *sequence unpacking* and what is the *del statement*.
